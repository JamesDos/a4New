Name(s) and NetID(s) of group members:
Lam Le ldl56 James Tu jt737
Time spent on the assignment, in hours:
12 hours
Implementation strategy:
    Split testing and TODOs between two partners via github. When error occured that we could not
    solve ourselves, we met up together or utilized office hours.

Testing strategy:
    Black box testing was used for each functions.
    After functions were created, we then used glass box testing and checking how different input
    affected our program. End to end testing was also glass box testing as a list of edge cases were
    utilized to very program responses.

Known problems:
    None as we know of.

Comments on the assignment:
    The assignment did a great job at building our confidence in recursion. The efficiency
    of TODO 8, did restrict out ability to use .get() methods, however it forced us to be
    tryout list iterators. Overall testing for this assignment was much more comprehensive due to
    the variations in possible input. The process of coming up with testing prior writing
    the function was very helpful in preventing rewriting code.
